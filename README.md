# Maze Solver

I created this repo to help myself and any other people learn data structures and algorithms better, a maze solver is always a great project on any new language you are learning


I've used recursive backtracking with the Depth First Algorithm for the generation of the maze and I will also be using the breadth first search for solving said maze
